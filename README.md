# AntSim

**AntSim** is an interactive ant colony simulation that models the complex behaviors and social interactions of ants. Designed to visualize the dynamics of a colony in a simplified 2D environment, AntSim allows users to observe how ants communicate, gather resources, and defend their nest. By assigning roles to each ant and enabling pheromone-based communication, AntSim offers a fascinating look into collective insect behavior.

AntSim provides an accessible way for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to study ant behaviors, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to follow the interactions within the colony.

## Features

### Role-based behaviors
Each ant is assigned a specific role to simulate a functioning colony:
- **Workers**: Collect food and lay pheromone trails to guide other ants.
- **Guards**: Protect the colony by detecting and responding to potential threats.
- **Nurses**: Care for the queen and the larvae, ensuring colony growth.

### Pheromone-based communication
- **Food trails**: Worker ants lay pheromone trails when they find food, leading others to the source.
- **Alert signals**: Guard ants release alert pheromones to warn the colony of nearby threats.
- **Reinforced paths**: Pheromone trails are strengthened by frequent use, helping ants find the shortest routes to resources.

### Dynamic interaction
The ants actively search for food and respond to threats through pheromone signals, creating a realistic and immersive simulation of colony behavior.

### Visual support
- **2D representation**: Ants are shown as small shapes moving on a map, with pheromone trails visible as colored paths that fade over time.
- **Interactive map**: Track ant movements and pheromone diffusion in real-time to observe colony interactions.

### Recording and Replay
- **Session recording**: Record and replay simulations to analyze key moments or interesting behaviors.
- **Shareable scenes**: Share recorded sequences with colleagues for further analysis.

## Technologies

- **Behavioral modeling**: Simulates collective behaviors based on role assignments and environmental stimuli.
- **Pheromone diffusion system**: Creates a realistic pheromone-based communication model where signals decay over time and are reinforced by traffic.
- **2D Visualization**: Provides an interactive, real-time graphical interface that illustrates the antsâ€™ movements and interactions.
